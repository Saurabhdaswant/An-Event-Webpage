            <h3>DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</h3>
            <p>
              Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or
              a beer fridge, and it doesn’t end with neckties, PCs, or big
              corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the
              motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what
              stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and for
              designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that
              embraces design and allows it to succeed. In Aaron’s session he
              will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that
              *get* design, both large and small. He will share what those
              teams, departments, and companies have that others don’t, and more
              importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace’s culture.
              Once you’ve worked within a culture of design it’s almost
              impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.
